# MoneyUp
## What is this?
MoneyUp is an application designed to be used by an employee and the employer in a workplace.

The employer must first create or add a user to the database in order for the employee to log in.

When the employee has an account they can log in and create an entry at the end of each workday, including how long they worked and the date.

The employee can also view their own personal account which will show them the total amount of hours they have worked and the total amount of money 
they have earned until the cycle is reset by the employer. An example of that would be if someone got paid every two weeks, they would be able to see
these calculations until they get paid at the end of the two weeks.

The employer can also see each employee's information to keep track of each day an individual worked and get an estimate of how much they have earned.
